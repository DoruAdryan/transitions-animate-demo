# Material design screen transitions in Android
Go from screen A to screen B in style. Let's learn together how to animate the transition between the pictures-grid-screen and the picture-details-screen, both on Android 5 and below

## Branch details
1. This branch contains the source code for the demo app that is used for [this presentation](http://andreidiaconu.github.io/transitions-animate-demo).
2. You can also view the presentation code (as it is done using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)) on the gh-pages branch
3. There are 8 Activities defined in this project. All of them have icons in the launcher for easy access.
4. Each of the 8 activities contains a step for going from the default animation to custom screen transitions in android.
5. A lot of code is dupliated. This is intentional - I want people to be able to study each step independent of other steps.
6. Feel free to fork, modify, contribute, etc if you feel like it.
