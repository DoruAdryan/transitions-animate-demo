# Material design screen transitions in Android - Presentation branch
Go from screen A to screen B in style. Let's learn together how to animate the transition between the pictures-grid-screen and the picture-details-screen, both on Android 5 and below

## Branch details
1. This branch contains the source code for the presentation, not the demo app. You can find the demo app source code on the master branch; this is the gh-pages branch.
2. index.html contains videos from dropbox; I don't want to stress github servers with video streaming.
3. local-videos.html contains local videos; it is to be used when making an offline presentation.
4. This uses [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/); I think it's awesome.
5. Feel free to fork, modify, contribute, etc if you feel like it.
